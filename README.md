<br>
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using Deep Learning is a desktop-based AI system that automatically analyzes human speech to detect the underlying emotional tone. This application bridges the fields of machine learning, signal processing, and human-computer interaction to create a tool that can "understand how someone feels" just by listening to a voice recording.

The goal of this project is to build an interactive, intelligent system capable of predicting emotions such as happy, sad, angry, fearful, and more â€” from raw audio inputs like .wav or .mp3 files. It leverages a pre-trained deep learning model built using Keras and trained on emotional speech datasets.

The application provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, which makes it beginner-friendly and usable without any coding knowledge. Users can simply browse an audio file, let the model process it, and receive an emotion prediction instantly, along with real-time audio playback using SoundDevice.
